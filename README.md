### dp - np

dp: dynamic programming, a method of finding max/min problem
p:  Polynomial problem, can find a polynomial algorithm to solve
np: Non-deterministic Polynomial problem, can check a answer in polynomial time

dp charicteristics

- remove duplicate problems (DP table)
- optimal sub problems (problems independent)
